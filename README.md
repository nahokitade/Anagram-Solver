README for HW1 of STEP Google Tokyo, Japan

The Anagram Solver includes the main function to demonstrate the 
functionality of the first assignment, plus a few extra functionalities.

Anagram Solver 2 and 3 only implement the basic function to solve a anagram problem but uses different implementations.

The main function uses the dictionary.txt file as the dictionary, but
another file can be used by changing the fileName portion of the main
function, in the formatting of the file is similar to dictionary.txt

Assumptions:
1. The dictionary file (and any files used in place of that) is formatted
with one word in every line of the file of all the words in a standard 
dictionary.
2. The main function takes in user inputs of a specific length (default set
to 16 chars) 
3. AngramSolver.java depends on the sorting function of QuickSort.java
