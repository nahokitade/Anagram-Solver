TESTING for HW1 of STEP Google Tokyo, Japan

Testing was quite difficult as it is hard to check if 
the longest words, and other functions of the AnagramSolver
as I could not completely make sure that the returned string/
strings were infact the longest creatable word, etc. 

Testing:
1. tested on astronomer and amongst all the two combination words,
was moon starer
2. all small subfunctions that is directly used, such as sort in 
QuickSort.java or leftChars function in AnagramSolver have gone through a simple unit testing, and have passed all edge case tests that I have done.
3. As for the function that finds the longest word, the word that 
gets returned is never a very short word, so hopefully it is infact
the longest.
